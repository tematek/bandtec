<h2>Sobre a vida de Chorão Syckness</h2>
<div id="index-sobre">
<p>  Go!

Stapled shut inside an outside world
And I'm sealed in tight, bizarre, but right at home
Claustrophobic, closing in and I'm
Catastrophic, not again
I'm smeared across the page, and doused in gasoline
I wear you like a stain, yet I'm the one who's obscene
Catch me up on all your sordid little insurrections
I've got no time to lose, I'm just caught up in all the cattle </p> 

    <p>
        Fray the strings
        Throw the shapes
        Hold your breath
        Listen
    </p>
 
    <p>
        I am a worm before I am a man
        I was a creature before I could stand
        I will remember before I forget
        Before I forget that
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm ripped across the ditch, and settled in the dirt
        And I wear you like a stitch, yet I'm the one who's hurt
        Pay attention to your twisted little indiscretions
        I've got no right to win, I'm just caught up all the battles
    </p>

    <p>
        Locked in clutch
        Pushed in place
        Hold your breath
        Listen
    </p>

    <p>
        I am a worm before I am a man
        I was a creature before I could stand
        I will remember before I forget
        Before I forget that
    </p>

    <p>

        I am a worm before I am a man
        I was a creature before I could stand
        I will remember before I forget
        Before I forget that
    </p>

    <p>

        My end
        It justifies my means
        All I ever do is delay
        My every attempt to evade
        The end of the road and my end
        It justifies my means
        All I ever do is delay
        My every attempt to evade
        The end of the road
    </p>

    <p>

        I am a worm before I am a man
        I was a creature before I could stand
        I will remember before I forget
        Before I forget that
    </p>

    <p>

        I am a worm before I am a man
        I was a creature before I could stand
        I will remember before I forget
        Before I forget that

    </p>

    <p>

        I am a worm before I am a man
        I was a creature before I could stand
        I will remember before I forget
        Before I forget that
    </p>
